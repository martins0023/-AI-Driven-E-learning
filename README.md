## Project Title: AI‑Powered Course Builder & Knowledge Checker

## What It Is:
A tool that turns a simple course title and section outline into a full, interactive learning experience—drafting lesson content, pulling in YouTube videos, summarizing key points, Interactive Objectives & quizzes, and saving creations in a personal gallery.


By simply entering a course title and outlining its main sections, the system uses AI to:

- Generate Course Content: Automatically drafts detailed lesson content for each section.

- Fetch and Integrate Resources: Scrapes YouTube for relevant video tutorials and embeds them alongside each lesson.

- Summarize & Review: Creates concise summaries of video and textual materials to reinforce learning.

- Interactive Objectives & Quizzes: Generates clear learning objectives and end‑of‑section quizzes; instantly grades answers and provides feedback.

- Course Gallery: Maintains a personalized dashboard where users can browse, revisit, and share the courses they’ve built.
